		<h1>Usage Notes:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can use two finger pinch or mouse wheel / scroll to zoom the canvas in and out.</li>
			<li>Undo and Redo are still pretty flaky. Use at your own risk. There is currently a 50 action hard undo-limit, but because of the inconsistent cleanup you might not have 50 undo states available.</li>
